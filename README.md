# Lab Assignment #4

In this exercise you will write an Android application that allows the
instructor to keep track of various tests performed by the students in
the Lab. Your application could be used by Lab instructors. Use **Room

manipulate the application's database. Create the following **entity**:

<table>

<col style="width: 100%" />
</colgroup>
<thead>
<tr>
<th style="text-align: center;"><strong>Exercise</strong></th>
</tr>

<tbody>
<tr>
<td style="text-align: left;"><p>StudentNumber</p>
<p>execiseCode</p>
<p>resultObtained</p>
<p>marks</p></td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
